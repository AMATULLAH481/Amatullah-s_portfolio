## [Project 1: Student Mental Health Analysis] (

##[Project 2: HR Distribution Employee report] (https://github.com/aDataJourney990/HR-employee-report)

This is a personal project I carried out to help practice my SQL skills, data visualization and data reading skills.

* Data was obtained from Kaggle.
* I made use of SQL for the data exploration, investigation  and querying.
* I also made use of SQL for the mapping out of the data's KPI.
* For the visualization and storytelling, I made use of Power BI
* I made use of filters to ensure interactivity and dynamic use.
